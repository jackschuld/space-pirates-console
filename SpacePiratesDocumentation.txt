I'll help you set up the Git repository with the branch structure mentioned in your README.md. I see you already have a `.gitignore` file with proper C# settings. Let's set up the branches.

First, let's make sure we're in the correct directory and initialize the repository if it hasn't been done yet:

```bash
cd C:\Users\johns\Projects\SpacePirates.Console && git status
```
I see we're getting a PowerShell error with `&&`. Let's modify our commands to work with PowerShell:

```bash
git status
```
Great, I see Git is initialized. Let's set up the branch structure according to your README.md. Here's what we'll do:

1. First, let's add all our files and make an initial commit on main:

```bash
git add .
```

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Basic game structure with movement, shields, and cargo systems"
```
2. Now let's create the staging branch:

```bash
git checkout -b staging
```
3. Now let's create a feature branch for the next feature we're working on (combat system):

```bash
git checkout -b feature/combat-system
```
Perfect! Now your Git repository is set up with the following branch structure:

1. `main` - Production-ready code (contains initial commit)
2. `staging` - Integration and testing branch (branched from main)
3. `feature/combat-system` - Feature branch for implementing combat (branched from staging)

Here's how to work with these branches:

1. Development workflow:
   - Work on features in feature branches (like `feature/combat-system`)
   - When a feature is complete, merge it into `staging` for testing
   - Once tested and stable, merge `staging` into `main`

2. Common Git commands you'll use:
   ```powershell
   # Switch between branches
   git checkout main
   git checkout staging
   git checkout feature/combat-system

   # Create a new feature branch
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name

   # Merge feature into staging
   git checkout staging
   git merge feature/combat-system

   # Merge staging into main when ready
   git checkout main
   git merge staging
   ```

3. To create additional feature branches in the future:
   ```powershell
   # First switch to staging (features branch from staging)
   git checkout staging
   # Create new feature branch
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

Would you like me to help you start implementing any particular feature in the `feature/combat-system` branch, or would you like to create a different feature branch?
